        <h4> I was an iOS development intern at Procore Technologies, a cloud-based construction management software company, from April to June 2014. At Procore, I improved the directory functionality by allowing users to be able to message their contacts directly from the Procore directory. I also integrated this functionality with the messaging software WhatsApp.</h4>

My portion was writing the entire mobile application, which included integrating the camera to capture business cards, creating a drawing interface to label various parts of the business cards to be read by OCR software, and JSON files to be sent off to the lead management system.</h4>
